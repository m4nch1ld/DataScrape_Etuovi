# DataScrape_Etuovi
This is a tutorial for real estate related data scraping from a Finnish site Etuovi.com.
The tutorial will help you build a piece of code that will help you find a suitable real-estate target (purchasing or rental). We will do a data scrape, clean the results, take them to excel, and finally plot them on the map.
Simply view the ipynb file, save the NeighborhoodWatch.xlsx to your project location, and follow the steps.

Shoutout to Abdishakur for the geopandas/geopy guide (https://towardsdatascience.com/geocode-with-python-161ec1e62b89), to Daebi for the hint regarding the map popups, and to  ocefpaf for the FastMarkerCluster !!!
